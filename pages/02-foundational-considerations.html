        <section id="introduction">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Before writing a single line of code, successful software projects must address a set of foundational considerations. These are architectural decisions and design patterns that, if ignored or deferred, will create technical debt and costly refactoring later.</p>
            
            <div class="warning-box">
                <strong>Critical Insight:</strong> Decisions made early in a project have exponential impact. A poor choice about coordinate systems, for example, might require touching thousands of files to fix later. Make these decisions carefully and deliberately at the start.

        <section id="the-17-foundations">
            <h2>The 17 Foundational Topics</h2>
            <p>This guide identifies 17 critical areas that must be considered from day one. Each gets its own detailed page, but here's an overview:</p>

            <h3>1. Coordinate System and Units</h3>
            <p>Establishes how we represent positions, orientations, and measurements in 3D space. Consistency here prevents countless bugs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Which axis is up? (Y-up vs Z-up)</li>
                <li>Right-handed or left-handed?</li>
                <li>Units of measurement (meters, centimeters, etc.)</li>
                <li>Angle representation (degrees vs radians)</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Error Handling and Validation</h3>
            <p>Defines how the application reports, handles, and recovers from errors. Critical for robustness.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Return value strategies (Result types, exceptions, error codes)</li>
                <li>Input validation approach</li>
                <li>Error propagation patterns</li>
                <li>Logging and diagnostics</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Asset Management</h3>
            <p>How 3D models, textures, and other resources are loaded, cached, and managed throughout the application lifecycle.</p>

            <h3>4. Performance Metrics and Profiling</h3>
            <p>Establishing baselines and monitoring systems for performance from the beginning, not as an afterthought.</p>

            <h3>5. Settings Management</h3>
            <p>How user preferences, editor settings, and configuration are stored and accessed.</p>

            <h3>6. Scene Hierarchy and Entity Management</h3>
            <p>The fundamental structure for organizing objects in the scene—the backbone of the editor.</p>

            <h3>7. Coordinate Spaces and Transforms</h3>
            <p>Understanding local, world, and view space transformations and their conversions.</p>

            <h3>8. Serialization and Versioning</h3>
            <p>How scenes are saved to disk and loaded back, with backward compatibility considerations.</p>

            <h3>9. Extensibility and Plugin Architecture</h3>
            <p>Even if plugins aren't in the MVP, designing for extensibility from the start is crucial.</p>

            <h3>10. Input Management System</h3>
            <p>Abstracting keyboard, mouse, and other input devices for testability and flexibility.</p>

            <h3>11. Command Pattern and Undo/Redo</h3>
            <p>Essential for any editor—users expect to undo mistakes. This must be architectural, not bolted on.</p>

            <h3>12. Memory Management Strategy</h3>
            <p>How memory is allocated, tracked, and deallocated. Particularly important for Vulkan and resource-intensive 3D applications.</p>

            <h3>13. Localization and Internationalization</h3>
            <p>Even for MVP, designing for multiple languages from the start avoids expensive refactoring.</p>

            <h3>14. Crash Recovery and Auto-Save</h3>
            <p>Protecting user work from data loss due to crashes or errors.</p>

            <h3>15. Documentation as Code</h3>
            <p>Treating documentation as a first-class artifact, versioned and maintained alongside code.</p>

            <h3>16. Build System and Dependencies</h3>
            <p>How the project is built, packaged, and distributed. Dependencies management strategy.</p>

            <h3>17. Test-Driven Development Architecture</h3>
            <p>Designing the entire application to be testable from day one—this is covered extensively in its own section.</p>

            <h2>Why These Considerations Matter</h2>
            
            <div class="card">
                <h3>Cost of Change Over Time</h3>
                <p>The cost of changing fundamental architectural decisions increases exponentially as a project matures:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Week 1:</strong> Changing coordinate systems affects a few files</li>
                    <li><strong>Month 3:</strong> Requires updating dozens of systems</li>
                    <li><strong>Year 1:</strong> May require rewriting major portions of the codebase</li>
                    <li><strong>After Release:</strong> Could break existing user content and require migration tools</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="info-box">
                <strong>Real-World Example:</strong> A game engine that initially used Z-up coordinates later needed to switch to Y-up to integrate with industry-standard asset pipelines. This change took 6 months, affected over 500 files, introduced numerous bugs, and delayed the project significantly. All of this could have been avoided with 30 minutes of research at the project's start.

        <section id="how-to-use">
            <h2>How to Use These Foundational Pages</h2>
            
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Read All 17 Topics:</strong> Before writing implementation code, read through all foundational consideration pages (3-18).</li>
                <li><strong>Make Decisions:</strong> For each topic, make explicit decisions documented in your project documentation.</li>
                <li><strong>Document Rationale:</strong> Write down <em>why</em> you made each decision. Future you (or your team) will thank you.</li>
                <li><strong>Create Guidelines:</strong> Convert decisions into coding guidelines and conventions.</li>
                <li><strong>Review Regularly:</strong> As the project evolves, periodically review these decisions to ensure they still serve the project.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section id="decision-framework">
            <h2>Decision-Making Framework</h2>
            <p>When evaluating options for each foundational consideration, ask:</p>

            <div class="tip-box">
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Industry Standards:</strong> What do most projects in this domain use?</li>
                    <li><strong>Ecosystem Compatibility:</strong> Will this work well with our chosen libraries and tools?</li>
                    <li><strong>Team Experience:</strong> What is our team familiar with?</li>
                    <li><strong>Future Flexibility:</strong> Does this decision lock us into a path or leave options open?</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing Impact:</strong> How does this affect testability?</li>
                    <li><strong>Performance:</strong> Are there performance implications?</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance Cost:</strong> Will this be easy or difficult to maintain?</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="documentation-template">
            <h2>Documentation Template</h2>
            <p>For each foundational topic, document your decision using this template:</p>

            <pre><code class="language-markdown">## [Topic Name]

### Decision
[What we decided to do]

### Rationale

        <section id="getting-started">
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>You're now ready to dive into the specific foundational topics. Each subsequent page (3-18) covers one topic in depth with:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Detailed explanation of the topic</li>
                <li>Common approaches and patterns</li>
